# Loan_Prediction



I solved a real life case study of Dream Housing Finance. The company deals in all home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Customers first apply for a home loan after that company validates the customer's eligibility. The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form.

By the end of the project, I had a solid understanding of Classification problem and Various approaches to solving the problem.

The step that I took in solving the problem:

I    Problem Statement
II   Hypothesis Generation
III  Getting the system ready and loading the data
IV   Understanding the Data
V    Univariate Analysis
VI   Bivariate Analysis
VII  Missing Value and Outlier Treatment
VIII Evaluation Metrics for Classification Problems
IX   Model Building : Part I
X    Logistic Regression using stratified k-folds cross validation
XI   Feature Engineering
XII  Model Building : Part II
